We&#8217;re now very close to releasing the Mac + Windows versions of Mixture for preview and so we decided to run a quick little experiment&#8230;

This video shows myself and Pete with the same Mixture project open through Dropbox. Pete is using the Mac version and I am on the Windows version, we are both working remotely.

It&#8217;s quite a cool side effect of using Mixture on a project managed by a service like Dropbox.

If you&#8217;re not sure what Mixture is all about, please check out my [original post](/post/31819131515/mixture).

If you&#8217;re interested in trying Mixture and would like to preview the apps when they are ready, please follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/teammixture)Â for updates.
