As of today I am going to begin building the front-end templates for [Mixture](http://mixture.io)&#8217;s registration, account management &amp; public profiles (screenshots below). These will be the real templates used when we open up access to Mixture - currently planned for the end of January / early February.

I thought it would be useful if I screencast sections of the build and process I take, detailing how I use Mixture and showcasing some of the features Mixture offers. My aim is to detail small sections and keep the screencasts as short and to the point as possible (hopefully).

I will also share the Mixture published Url so as you can view and see the progress for yourself.

This may change, but I will aim to cover&#8230;

* Starting my project / quick Mixture overview / project structure
* Setting up my styles and preprocessing (I will be using Sass)
* Setting up my templates (layouts, includes)
* Using model test data with my templates and ajax calls (Models)
* Publishing and sharing my progress online

If you are interested in following my progress, please keep checkin my blog or follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/neiltak)

Here&#8217;s a peek at the designs I will be building (4 screenshots)&#8230;
