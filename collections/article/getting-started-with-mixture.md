I&#8217;m currently working on a series of posts and screencasts for Mixture which will focus on individual features and better describe how you can use them.

Here&#8217;s my current release plan&#8230;

1. Overview, briefly introducing all that Mixture has to offer
2. Project structure &amp; templating
3. Preprocessors (including debugging with the chrome extension)
4. Models (how you can use real or test data with Mixture)
5. Optimisation &amp; debugging
6. Local development (hostnames &amp; multi-device testing, inc. live reload)
7. Pushing a project online<div>Each screencast will be added to the documentation site [http://docs.mixture.io/tutorials](http://docs.mixture.io/tutorials) as they become available.</div>

If you are interested in this series then please follow @[TeamMixture](http://twitter.com/teammixture) for updates.
