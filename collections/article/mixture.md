Mixture is a new tool I am working on with [Pete Nelson](http://twitter.com/petetak) and [Mike Kus](http://twitter.com/mikekus). It&#8217;s basically a Mac &amp; Windows application enabling rapid development / prototyping.

It&#8217;s a tool we&#8217;ve personally desired for sometime and so we&#8217;re building in features that improve a users work flow and enable collaboration, we have lot&#8217;s of cool ideas and plans to push the product forward.

The video is a very quick preview screencast I put together. We are now a week or two away from releasing the apps for preview, if you want to be one of the first to try Mixture please follow on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/teammixture) for announcements.
