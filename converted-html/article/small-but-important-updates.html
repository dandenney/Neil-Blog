                    <h1>Small but important updates</h1>
                    <div class="date">Posted: <span>Thu Apr 04 2013</span></div>

                    <p>If you&#8217;re using <a href="http://mixture.io">Mixture</a> you may have noticed we are pushing updates continuously, improvements, fixes and new features.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve just made another small but powerful update.</p>
<p>Mixture currently has two project types (or modes) &#8220;Mixture&#8221; and &#8220;Simple&#8221;.</p>
<p>A Mixture project benefits from all of the features and functionality that the tool and online services offer, builtin server, friendly urls, liquid templates, HTML, preprocessing, minifcation, live refresh, multi-device testing, quick publish and so on.</p>
<p>The idea behind simple mode was to allow non-mixture projects to benefit from some of the same features detailed above, so we built a feature into simple mode that allows Mixture to partner with any server (mamp, wamp, etc) and automatically enable live refresh, style injection and multi-device testing.</p>
<p>We think this is pretty powerful and very flexible.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;ve had feedback from users, who didn&#8217;t necessarily want to jump into a Mixture project, but also didn&#8217;t have a server running for their project. Usually thats because the project they are building is simply static HTML files.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s pretty straight forward to convert a project into a Mixture project, we thought we could make it easier to run these types of projects in Mixture.</p>
<p>So as of today and the latest update&#8230;</p>
<p>If you use Mixture in simple mode and <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> set a partner server, Mixture will boot a lightweight version of its own server. This server will parse HTML files and assets, it will even add live refresh, style injection and multi-device ability automatically!</p>
<p>As an example, if in the root of your project directory you had a file called &#8220;about.html&#8221; you could simply &#8220;view locally&#8221; on Mixture and then go to the url &#8220;/about&#8221; to view that page. Any changes to styles or the page will be automatically visible.</p>
<p>We really hope you like this small addition.</p>
