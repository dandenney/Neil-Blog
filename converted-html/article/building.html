                    <p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/5ea5091108914e34c4af40f6d42cb3fd/tumblr_inline_mjybqccyH81qz4rgp.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Over the last few months we&#8217;ve been building and alpha testing <a href="http://mixture.io">Mixture</a>.</p>
<p>Wednesday (20th) we opened it up and moved into public beta, we&#8217;ve by no means finished, in fact we&#8217;re just getting warmed up. We have lots to do and lots planned&#8230; I really can&#8217;t wait to show some of the things we are working on.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a hard journey, the last two weeks have been particularly tough. When we started building Mixture the idea was very focused and the application quite small, it didn&#8217;t stay this way for long.</p>
<p>2 weeks ago we decided that we needed to implement the changes we had in mind before we moved into beta, it was a tough decision as we knew it was going to be a massive amount of work, but I&#8217;m very glad we did as I am really pleased with the outcome so far.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re a small team and It&#8217;s the first desktop application we&#8217;ve built as we were firmly routed in the web, so it&#8217;s been a big challenge and a steep learning curve.</p>
<p>The idea went from &#8220;Hey, lets build a simple app to aid our front-end development needs&#8221; to&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>A native Mac application</li>
<li>A native Windows application</li>
<li>An API</li>
<li>A web service for published projects</li>
<li>A marketing site</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230; and all of the &#8220;things&#8221; that come with each of these.</p>
<p>As soon as I get time, I fully intend to write more about our experiences and the challenges we&#8217;ve faced - hopefully they will be of interest to someone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very excited about Mixture and our plans, can&#8217;t wait to see how people use it and what they build with it.</p>
<p>This post is also an excuse to thank some people, firstly thank you to everyone who signed up to use Mixture, all of the alpha testers and anyone that has been involved or helped in any way.</p>
<p>A special thank you to the following people who have been super responsive&#8230;</p>
<p>Oli Lisher, Dan Denney, Stu Robson, Keir Whitaker, Toby Howarth, Kieran Masterton, Shane Hudson, Stuart Burrows, Benjamin Parry, Darrell Wilson, Tom Kenny, Adam Whitcroft, Adam Robertson, James Wilson, Ollie Wells, Hamish Taplin, Benn Pearson, Harry Roberts, Matt Reich, Josh Long, Martin De Lima, Dan Edwards, Tom Kentell, Marine Barbaroux, Neil Davidson, Simon Elliston Ball, Tim Whitlock, Ritesh Arora, Nakul Aggarwal, Jelmer Borst, Vanessa Gorman, Will Glynn&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I have missed some people off this list, apologies if I have - it&#8217;s been a long week.</p>
